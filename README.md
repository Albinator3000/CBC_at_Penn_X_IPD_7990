**February 18, 2026 · Tangen Hall · Spring 2026**

A live workshop session exploring how IPD students can use Claude and Claude Code to accelerate every stage of their final projects — from user research synthesis to working prototypes.

Presented by **Albert Opher** — M&T '25, Anthropic Campus Ambassador, Founder of the Penn Claude Builder Club.

## What This Session Covers

We look at three modes of working with Claude, mapped directly to your IPD projects:

| Mode | What it means |
|------|--------------|
| **Augment** | Claude as a thinking partner — research synthesis, competitive analysis, brand copy, financial logic |
| **Automate** | Claude as a workflow engine — pipelines that run repeatedly without you |
| **Agentic (Claude Code)** | Claude as a builder — reads your codebase, writes files, runs commands, ships working prototypes |

The live demo uses Claude Code to ideate on and prototype features across all 8 IPD final projects in real time.

## The 8 Projects

### 1. Gardener Marketplace
*A multi-sided marketplace connecting gardeners with customers*

**Claude Code:** Build the MVP — gardener profiles, listing search by location and specialty, in-app messaging, Stripe checkout mock, map view of available gardeners nearby.

**Augment:** Stress-test the cold start problem. Who do you acquire first — gardeners or customers? Claude can generate onboarding copy for each side, draft a referral incentive structure, and model unit economics per transaction.

**Automate:** New gardener signups → Claude auto-generates profile descriptions from a short intake form, flags geographic coverage gaps, and sends a weekly booking digest.

> **Key insight:** The cold start problem IS the product design problem. Build for the moment before both sides exist.

### 2. AI Internship Platform
*AI-powered matching between students and internship opportunities*

**Claude Code:** Student intake form with resume upload, employer-side job posting, Claude-powered fit scoring with plain-English explanations, ranked candidate dashboard, interview prep module tailored to each student's background and role.

**Augment:** Draft the matching rubric. Think through pricing — per-placement fee, SaaS, or freemium? Generate the positioning against LinkedIn, Handshake, and human recruiters.

**Automate:** Applications come in → Claude screens them, generates a one-paragraph candidate summary, flags standouts, and emails a digest to the employer. Zero manual review until interview stage.

> **Key insight:** The tool you're pitching IS the tool that builds and validates it. The self-referential demo is your strongest pitch moment.

### 3. Pet Health Detector
*Detecting health issues in pets through symptom analysis*

**Claude Code:** Symptom intake flow (species, age, symptoms, duration, severity) → Claude triage returning one of three outputs: monitor at home / schedule a vet / go to emergency now — with a plain-English explanation and specific next steps.

**Augment:** Think through the liability edge cases. What happens when the model is wrong? How do you word outputs to be genuinely useful without practicing veterinary medicine? Claude can draft a responsible disclosure framework and terms of service.

**Automate:** Each session logs symptom + triage output. Claude identifies patterns across users, generates a weekly insight digest, and flags protocols that are getting poor feedback — useful for vet partner relationships.

> **Key insight:** The triage model is the product. The defensible thing is knowing exactly where the line is between "reassure" and "escalate."

### 4. Language Learning for Intermediates
*Improving language skills for intermediate speakers*

**Claude Code:** Conversational practice interface — user picks a language and topic, Claude conducts a natural conversation, quietly tracks which words and structures the user struggles with, surfaces a personalized vocabulary list and grammar notes at the end of each session.

**Augment:** Map the intermediate plateau in detail — what exactly breaks down at B1/B2? Generate a competency framework. Draft positioning against Duolingo, Babbel, and iTalki: why is adaptive AI conversation different from everything else?

**Automate:** After each session, Claude generates a progress summary, updates the user's personal difficulty profile, and queues focus areas for the next session — a learning loop that gets more personalized over time.

> **Key insight:** The intermediate plateau exists because learners need a patient, adaptive sparring partner — not more flashcards. That's the moat.

### 5. City Guide for Foreigners
*Helping foreigners navigate and settle into a new city*

**Claude Code:** Dynamic onboarding quiz (home country, budget, interests, time constraints, neighborhood preference) → Claude generates a fully personalized city guide with ranked recommendations, map links, and a "why this fits you" explanation for each entry.

**Augment:** Define what makes the curation defensible. Anyone can make a list — the edge is the local knowledge layer. Use Claude to synthesize expat forums, subreddits, and community sources into structured insights that feel like advice from a friend who actually lives there.

**Automate:** As users save and rate places, Claude updates their preference model and proactively surfaces new recommendations. When a user asks "find me something like that but cheaper," Claude already knows their history.

> **Key insight:** "Foreigner in a new city" is not one persona — it's a Japanese engineer on a 1-year contract, a Brazilian student for a semester, a French retiree moving permanently. Claude lets you serve all of them with one product.

---

### 6. Robot Tree Saw
*An autonomous robot saw for trimming trees*

**Claude Code:** Operator dashboard — real-time sensor feed visualization, safety threshold configuration UI, cut job scheduling, alert system for anomalies (blade speed, torque, proximity), job log with before/after documentation.

**Augment:** Draft the safety protocol documentation. Generate a failure mode analysis (what happens if X sensor fails?), write the operator training manual, and think through regulatory requirements (OSHA, ANSI standards for autonomous cutting equipment).

**Automate:** After each job, Claude processes sensor logs, flags anomalies for review, auto-generates a maintenance checklist based on usage patterns, and drafts the customer-facing job completion report.

> **Key insight:** For hardware projects, the software layer is often under-designed because the team is focused on the physical build. Claude lets you go deep on UX and safety documentation without pulling engineering time away from the saw.

### 7. Family Habit Device
*A toy/device helping families and kids develop good habits*

**Claude Code:** Habit tracking app — family member profiles, habit setup with custom goals, streak tracking, reward system with age-appropriate incentives, parent dashboard with override controls, weekly family progress report.

**Augment:** Think through engagement decay — what happens at week 3 when novelty wears off? Model different family archetypes (competitive family, relaxed household, single-parent) and design reward structures that work across them. Generate a content library of age-appropriate encouragement messages.

**Automate:** Each week, Claude generates a personalized family report card, suggests new habits based on what's working, writes encouragement messages tailored to each child's streak, and flags habits being abandoned so parents can intervene early.

> **Key insight:** Habit products live and die on week 3, not week 1. Design for the moment when it stops being fun — that's where you earn your place in the family routine or get deleted.

---

### 8. Athletic Gear Cleaner
*Cleaning hard-to-clean athletic gear*

**Claude Code:** Gear intake quiz (sport, gear type, material, usage frequency, problem — odor, stain, breakdown) → Claude generates a personalized cleaning protocol with product recommendations, step-by-step instructions, a care schedule, and a "what NOT to do" section for each gear type.

**Augment:** Build the underlying knowledge base. Claude can synthesize manufacturer care guidelines, athlete forums, and materials science into a structured framework of what cleaning approaches work for which gear. This becomes the proprietary content moat — the reason your protocol beats googling.

**Automate:** After a customer uses the protocol, Claude follows up, captures structured feedback, updates the recommendation model, and flags protocols getting poor results. The cleaning database gets smarter with every customer interaction.

> **Key insight:** The product is not the cleaning solution — it's the protocol and the education. Claude lets you build a knowledge base that would take months of research, and keep it updated as new gear materials hit the market.
